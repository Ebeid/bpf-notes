Traditionally, BPF could only be attached to sockets for socket filtering. BPF's first use case was in `tcpdump`. When you run `tcpdump` the filter is compiled into a BPF program and attached to a raw `AF_PACKET` socket in order to print out filtered packets.

But over the years, eBPF added the ability to attach to [other kernel objects](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L117-L133). In addition to socket filtering, some supported attach points are:

*   Kprobes (and userspace equivalents uprobes)
*   Tracepoints
*   Network schedulers or qdiscs for classification or action (tc)
*   XDP (eXpress Data Path) This and other, newer features like in-kernel helper functions and shared data-structures (maps) that can be used to communicate with user space, extend BPF's capabilities.

**Notes**
- This also implies that API users must clear/zero sizeof(bpf_attr), as compiler can size-align the struct differently, to avoid garbage data to be interpreted as parameters by future kernels.

## BPF: sockmap and sk redirect support
- John Fastabend: https://lwn.net/Articles/731133/
- Sample problem: https://github.com/linus5/linux-kernel-xdp/commit/f0c18713b4e6d5398fc9cb8b24a61c566ecbd166

This series implements a sockmap and socket redirect helper for BPF
using a model similar to XDP netdev redirect. A sockmap is a BPF map
type that holds references to sock structs. Then with a new sk
redirect bpf helper BPF programs can use the map to redirect skbs
between sockets,

      bpf_sk_redirect_map(map, key, flags)

Finally, we need a call site to attach our BPF logic to do socket
redirects. We added hooks to recv_sock using the existing strparser
infrastructure to do this. The call site is added via the BPF attach
map call. To enable users to use this infrastructure a new BPF program
BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_SKB is created that allows users to reference sock
details, such as port and ip address fields, to build useful socket
layer program. The sockmap datapath is as follows,

     recv -> strparser -> verdict/action

where this series implements the drop and redirect actions.
Additional, actions can be added as needed.

A sample program is provided to illustrate how a sockmap can
be integrated with cgroups and used to add/delete sockets in
a sockmap. The program is simple but should show many of the
key ideas.

To test this work test_maps in selftests/bpf was leveraged.
We added a set of tests to add sockets and do send/recv ops
on the sockets to ensure correct behavior. Additionally, the
selftests tests a series of negative test cases. We can expand
on this in the future.

I also have a basic test program I use with iperf/netperf
clients that could be sent as an additional sample if folks
want this. It needs a bit of cleanup to send to the list and
wasn't included in this series.

For people who prefer git over pulling patches out of their mail
editor I've posted the code here,
